## Instructions

1. Check the roadmap and work on ONE ITEM AT A TIME.
2. Before beginning the implementation, if you have a question for the user, this is the best time to ask.
3. Proceed with the implementation to completion.
4. Inform the user that you have completed the item and ask them to test (if it is something that can be tested or if it is a visual change)
5. If the user provides feedback, work on it.
6. If the user is happy with the work, proceed to finalizing the item.
7. Finalizing means: CHECK THE CHECKBOX OF THE ITEM AND CHANGED PENDING TO COMPLETE i.e `- [x] - COMPLETED`.
8. AFTER CHECKING IT OFF, ONLY THEN DO YOU CREATE A COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT TIES BACK TO THE ITEM.
9. Ask the user if you can move on to the next item


### TO NOTE
- Do not at any point run `npm run dev`, that is only reserved for the user. It is already running, so there is no need to start another server
- You can run other checks for lint to make sure the type errors are resolved
